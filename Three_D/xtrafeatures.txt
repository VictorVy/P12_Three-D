improved cursor movement (no wonky jittering/shaking)
vertical movement (shift/space to move up/down)
third-person view (mouse scroll wheel to zoom in/out)
snow cloud (randomly produces randomly-moving snowflakes under itself) (one follows the player around)
mode framework
cool intro (kinda) (title "looks" at mouse) ("floating" buttons)
