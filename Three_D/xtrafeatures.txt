improved cursor movement (no wonky jittering/shaking)
vertical movement (shift/space to move up/down)
third-person view (mouse scroll wheel to zoom in/out) (with improved camera movement!)
snow cloud (randomly produces randomly-moving snowflakes under itself) (one follows the player around)
mode framework (press 'p' to pause/unpause)
cool intro (title "looks" at mouse) ("floating" buttons)
